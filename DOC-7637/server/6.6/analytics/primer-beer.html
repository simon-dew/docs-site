<h2 id="Welcome_to_analytics"><a class="anchor" href="#Welcome_to_analytics"></a>Welcome to Couchbase Analytics!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since few things in life are more important than choosing the right beer to pair with one&#8217;s main dish,
this tutorial explores the pairing of Analytics and beers.
You&#8217;ll create a set of Analytics datasets based on the Couchbase beer-sample bucket and then explore a set of
illustrative queries as a quick way to get familiar with the new Analytics user experience.
The complete set of steps to create and connect the sample datasets are included, along with a collection of runnable
N1QL for Analytics queries and their expected results.
(N1QL for Analytics is a Couchbase implementation, focused on parallel data analysis, of an emerging SQL-for-JSON query
language specification called SQL&#43;&#43;.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you read through this document, you should try each step for yourself on your own Analytics instance.
You can use your favorite Analytics interface to do this: the Analytics Workbench, the <a href="../tools/cbq-shell.html">cbq shell</a>,
or the REST API. For details, see <a href="run-query.html">Running Queries</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can verify that everything&#8217;s working by issuing a simple N1QL for Analytics test query as shown below:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>"Let there be beer!";</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have reached the end of this tutorial, you will be armed and dangerous, having all the basic Analytics
knowledge that you&#8217;ll need to start down the path of exploring the power of NoSQL data analytics.
You will find this to be a freeing experience.
Analytics queries never touch your Couchbase data servers, running instead (in parallel) on real-time shadow
copies of your data.
As a result, you&#8217;ll find yourself in a world where you can <em>ask the system anything!</em>  You won&#8217;t need to worry about
slowing down the Couchbase Server nodes with complex queries, you won&#8217;t have to create indexes before you begin
exploring your data, and the query language won&#8217;t try to keep you from asking queries that would be too
performance-costly.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section you will learn about the Analytics world model for data.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="Organizing_data_in_analytics"><a class="anchor" href="#Organizing_data_in_analytics"></a>Organizing Data in Analytics</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The top-level organizing concept in the Analytics data world is the <em>dataverse</em>.
A <strong>dataverse</strong>, short for data universe, is a namespace that gives you a place to create and manage datasets and
other artifacts for a given Analytics application.
In that respect, a dataverse is similar to a database or a schema in a relational DBMS.
To store your data in Analytics, you create a dataverse and then use it to hold the <em>datasets</em> for your own data.
We&#8217;ll get to this next.
You get a <em>Default</em> dataverse for free, and Analytics will just use that if you don&#8217;t specify another dataverse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Datasets</strong> are containers that hold collections of JSON objects.
They are similar to tables in an RDBMS or keyspaces in N1QL.
A dataset is <em>linked</em> to a Couchbase bucket, so that the dataset can ingest data from Couchbase Server.
In this tutorial, all of the datasets you create contain real-time synchronized copies of selected data from
Couchbase Server.
Analytics uses DCP to automatically maintain its own local representations for the JSON documents in the Couchbase
Server data nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Analytics does not prescribe the information that the dataset may contain.
This allows data to vary from one instance to another, and it leaves room for applications to evolve as data
requirements change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK, let&#8217;s put these concepts to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A newly created Analytics instance starts out <em>empty</em>.
That is, it contains no data other than the Analytics system catalogs.
These system catalogs live in a special dataverse called the <strong>Metadata</strong> dataverse.
If you want to know what dataverses have been defined so far, you can query the Dataverse dataset in the Metadata
dataverse as shown below:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT * FROM Metadata.`Dataverse`;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The output will look as follows on a freshly installed system:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[
  {
    "Dataverse": {
      "DataverseName": "Default",
      "DataFormat": "org.apache.asterix.runtime.formats.NonTaggedDataFormat",
      "Timestamp": "Fri Aug 17 09:47:38 BST 2018",
      "PendingOp": 0
    }
  },
  {
    "Dataverse": {
      "DataverseName": "Metadata",
      "DataFormat": "org.apache.asterix.runtime.formats.NonTaggedDataFormat",
      "Timestamp": "Fri Aug 17 09:47:38 BST 2018",
      "PendingOp": 0
    }
  }
]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The output above shows that a fresh Analytics instance starts out with two dataverses, one called <em>Metadata</em>
(the system catalog) and one called <em>Default</em> (available for holding data).
This sample scenario deals with the information about beers and breweries, which you&#8217;ll need to get from
Couchbase Server.
To keep things simple, we will use the <em>Default</em> dataverse here.
That means your first task is to tell Analytics about the Couchbase Server data that you want to shadow and the
datasets where you want it to live.
The following pair of Analytics DDL statements shows you how to tell Analytics to pay attention to the
<code>beer-sample</code> bucket in Couchbase Server,
where all of the beer and brewery information resides; they direct Analytics to shadow the data using two datasets,
<code>breweries</code> and <code>beers</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre> CREATE DATASET breweries ON `beer-sample` WHERE `type` = "brewery";

 CREATE DATASET beers ON `beer-sample` WHERE `type` = "beer";</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These two <em>CREATE DATASET</em> statements create the target datasets in Analytics for the information of interest.
Notice how <em>WHERE</em> clauses are utilized to direct beer-related data into separate, type-specific datasets for easier
querying.
Each of these datasets will be hash-partitioned (sharded) across all of the nodes running instances of the Analytics
service.
Hash partitioning sets the stage for the parallel processing that Analytics employs when processing analytical queries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To actually initiate the shadowing relationship of these datasets to the data in Couchbase Server, one more step is
needed, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>CONNECT LINK Local;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you run this statement, Analytics begins making its copy of the Couchbase Server documents and continuously
monitors it for changes.
The <em>CONNECT LINK</em> statement activates the connectivity between Analytics and a Couchbase Server cluster instance.
In this case, the data of interest is in the local server (i.e., it is managed by the Data service in the same cluster).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="Whats_lurking_in_the_shadows"><a class="anchor" href="#Whats_lurking_in_the_shadows"></a>What&#8217;s Lurking in the Shadows?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, verify that your datasets are really there and being populated.
The following <em>SELECT</em> statements are one good way to accomplish that:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT ds.BucketName, ds.DatasetName, ds.`Filter`
FROM Metadata.`Dataset` ds
WHERE ds.DataverseName = "Default";</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The query looks in the Analytics system catalogs for datasets that have been created in the <em>Default</em> dataverse.
At this point, assuming that you are just getting started, you will see only your two new datasets:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[
  {
    "DatasetName": "beers",
    "BucketName": "beer-sample",
    "Filter": "`type` = \"beer\""
  },
  {
    "DatasetName": "breweries",
    "BucketName": "beer-sample",
    "Filter": "`type` = \"brewery\""
  }
]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following query asks Analytics the number of breweries:</p>

<h2 id="Querying_your_analytics_data"><a class="anchor" href="#Querying_your_analytics_data"></a>N1QL for Analytics: Querying Your Analytics Data</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Congratulations! You now have your Couchbase Server beer-related data being shadowed in Analytics.
You&#8217;re ready to start running ad hoc queries against your breweries and beers datasets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To do this, you&#8217;ll query Analytics using N1QL for Analytics, a SQL-inspired language designed for working with
semistructured data.
This language has much in common with SQL, but there are differences due to the data model that N1QL for Analytics is
designed to serve.
SQL was designed in the 1970s to interact with the flat, schematic world of relational databases.
N1QL for Analytics is designed for the nested, schemaless world of NoSQL systems.
N1QL for Analytics offers a mostly familiar paradigm for experienced SQL users to use to query and manipulate data
in Analytics.
N1QL for Analytics is also related to N1QL for Query, the current query language used in Couchbase Server.
N1QL for Analytics is mostly a functional superset of N1QL for Query that is a bit closer to SQL,
and the differences between the two N1QL variants will shrink (and should eventually disappear) in future releases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, we introduce N1QL for Analytics via a set of example queries with their expected results,
based on the data above, to help you get started. Many of the most important features of N1QL for Analytics are
presented in this set of representative queries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For more information on the query language, see <a href="1_intro.html">N1QL for Analytics Language Reference</a>
and the list of built-in functions in the <a href="8_builtin.html">Function Reference</a>.
As you will learn, N1QL for Analytics is a highly composable expression language.
Even the very simple expression <code>1 + 1</code> is a valid query that evaluates to
<code>2</code>.
Try it for yourself!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that each time you execute a query, the Analytics query engine employs state-of-the-art parallel
processing algorithms similar to those used by the parallel relational DBMSs that power many enterprise data warehouses.
Unlike those systems, Analytics also works on rich, flexible schema data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s go ahead and write some queries and start learning N1QL for Analytics through examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="Query_0_key_based_lookup"><a class="anchor" href="#Query_0_key_based_lookup"></a>Query 0 - Key-Based Lookup</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For your first query, let&#8217;s find a particular brewery based on its Couchbase Server key.
You can do this for the Kona Brewing company as follows:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to simply binding variables to data instances and returning them <em>whole</em>, a N1QL for Analytics query can
construct new objects to return based on combinations of variable bindings.
This gives N1QL for Analytics the power to do projections and joins much like those done using multi-table <em>FROM</em>
clauses in SQL.
For example, suppose that you wanted a list of all breweries paired with their associated beers, with the list
enumerating the brewery name and the beer name for each such pair.
You can do this as follows in N1QL for Analytics while also limiting the answer set size to at most 3 results:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT bw.name AS brewer, br.name AS beer
FROM breweries bw, beers br
WHERE br.brewery_id = meta(bw).id
ORDER BY bw.name, br.name
LIMIT 3;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result of this query is a sequence of new objects, one for each brewery/beer pair.
Each instance in the result will be a object containing two fields, "brewer" and "beer", containing the brewery&#8217;s
name and the beer&#8217;s name, respectively, for each brewery/beer pair.
Notice how the use of a SQL-style <em>SELECT</em> clause, as opposed to the new N1QL for Analytics <em>SELECT VALUE</em> clause,
automatically results in the construction of a new object value for each result.</p>

<p>This version of the query uses an explicit object constructor to build each result object.
Note that the string field names "bw" and "br" in the object constructor above are both simple query expressions

N1QL for Analytics a very powerful tool for slicing and dicing semistructured data.</p>

<div class="paragraph">

<h3 id="Query_4"><a class="anchor" href="#Query_4"></a>Query 4 - Nested Outer Join</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to support joins between tables with missing or dangling join tuples, the designers of SQL ended up
shoe-horning a subset of the relational algebra into SQL&#8217;s <em>FROM</em> clause syntax and providing a variety of join types
there for users to choose from (which N1QL for Analytics supports for SQL compatibility).
Left outer joins are particularly important in SQL, for example, to print a summary of customers and orders, grouped
by customer, without omitting those customers who haven&#8217;t placed any orders yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The N1QL for Analytics language supports nesting, both of queries and of query results, and the combination allows for
a cleaner and more natural approach to such queries.
As an example, suppose you wanted for each brewery to produce an object that contains the brewery name along with a
list of all of the brewery&#8217;s offered beer names and alcohol percentages.
In the flat (also known as 1NF) world of SQL, approximating this query would involve a left outer join between
breweries and beers, ordered by brewery, with the brewery name being repeated along side each beer&#8217;s information.
In the richer (NoSQL) world of N1QL for Analytics this use case can be handled more naturally as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT bw.name AS brewer,
  (SELECT br.name, br.abv FROM beers br
   WHERE br.brewery_id = meta(bw).id
   ORDER BY br.name) AS beers
FROM breweries bw
ORDER BY bw.name
LIMIT 2;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This N1QL for Analytics query binds the variable <code>bw</code> to the objects in breweries;
for each brewery, it constructs a result object containing a "brewer" field with the brewery&#8217;s name, plus a "beers"
field with a nested collection of objects containing the beer name and alcohol percentage for each of the brewery&#8217;s
beers.
The nested collection field for each brewery is created using a correlated subquery.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>

While it looks like nested loops could be involved in computing the result, Analytics
recognizes the equivalence of such a query to an outer join, so it will use an efficient parallel join strategy when
actually computing the query&#8217;s result.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The expressive power of N1QL for Analytics includes support for queries involving <em>some</em> (existentially quantified)
and <em>all</em> (universally quantified) query semantics.
Quantified predicates are especially useful for querying datasets involving nested collections of objects, in order
to find objects where some or all of their nested sets' objects satisfy a condition of interest.
To illustrate their use in such situations, we start here by using N1QL for Analytics&#8217;s <em>WITH</em> clause (another
orthogonal feature of the query language) to create a temporarily nested view of breweries and their beers.
We then use an existential (<em>SOME</em>) predicate to find those breweries whose beers include at least one IPA and return
the brewery&#8217;s name, phone number, and complete list of beer names and associated alcohol levels.
Here is the resulting N1QL for Analytics query:</p>

<h3 id="Query_8"><a class="anchor" href="#Query_8"></a>Query 8 - Simple Aggregation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like SQL, the N1QL for Analytics language provides support for computing aggregates over large amounts of data.
As a very simple example, the following query computes the total number of beers in a SQL-like way:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_beers FROM beers;</pre>

<pre>[
  {
    "num_beers": 5891
  }
]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you prefer an <em>unwrapped</em> value, you could use the following variant instead:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT VALUE COUNT(b) FROM beers b;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This time the result will simply be:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[
  5891
]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In N1QL for Analytics aggregate functions can be applied to arbitrary collections, including subquery results.
To illustrate, here is a less SQL-like, and also more explicit, way to express the query above:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT VALUE ARRAY_COUNT((SELECT b FROM beers b));</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For each traditional SQL aggregate function <em>F</em>, N1QL for Analytics has a corresponding function <em>ARRAY_F</em> that
can be used to perform the desired aggregate calculation.
Each such function is a regular function that takes a collection-valued argument to aggregate over.
Thus, the query above counts the results produced by the beer selection subquery, and the previous, more SQL-like
versions are just syntactic sugar for N1QL for Analytics queries that logically use <em>ARRAY_COUNT</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="Query_9"><a class="anchor" href="#Query_9"></a>Query 9 (and friends) - Grouping and Aggregation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also like SQL, N1QL for Analytics supports grouped aggregation.
For each brewery that offers more than 30 beers, the following group-by or aggregate query reports the number of
beers that it offers.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT br.brewery_id, COUNT(*) AS num_beers
FROM beers br
GROUP BY br.brewery_id
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 30
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>FROM</em> clause incrementally binds the variable <code>br</code> to beers, and the <em>GROUP
BY</em> clause groups the beers by their associated brewery id.
Unlike SQL, where data is tabular (flat), the data model underlying N1QL for Analytics allows for nesting.
Thus, due to the <em>GROUP BY</em> clause, the <em>SELECT</em> clause in this query sees a sequence of <em>br</em> groups, with each such
group having an associated <code>brewery_id</code> variable value (that is the producing
brewery&#8217;s id).
In the context of the <em>SELECT</em> clause, <code>brewery_id</code> is bound to the brewery&#8217;s id
and <code>br</code> is now re-bound (due to grouping) to the <em>set</em> of beers issued by that
brewery.
The <em>SELECT</em> clause yields a result object containing the brewery&#8217;s id and the count of the items in the associated
beer set.
The query result will contain one such object per brewery id.</p>

Changes in the data are usually shadowed in Analytics in almost real time.
However, if a Data node fails over, the Analytics service may have to resynchronize data from scratch.
When this happens, there is a chance that Analytics queries may return incorrect results
until resynchronization is complete.
You can use the <a href="run-query.html#Using_analytics_workbench">Analytics Workbench</a>
or the <a href="rest-analytics.html">REST API</a> to check the progress of resynchronization.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last but not least, if you&#8217;re a database fan who has come this far, you may be wondering about indexing.
Indeed, in addition to the use of efficient parallel execution strategies for large analytical queries, Couchbase
Analytics provides support for the use of indexes to speed the execution of smaller queries.
For example, consider the following query:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT VALUE br
FROM beers br
WHERE br.brewery_id = 'kona_brewing';</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following DDL statement could be used to accelerate its execution for a large collection of beers:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>CREATE INDEX brewerIndex ON beers (brewery_id: STRING);</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that a CREATE INDEX statement needs to specify the type as well as the name of the field to be indexed; the
above brewerIndex will be used to speed queries that have string-based brewery_id predicates.
For the curious, you can verify the use of the new index by comparing the query plans that are produced
(by using the Plan tab in the Analytics Query Editor) both with and without the existence of the index.</p>
