<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since few things in life are more important than choosing the right beer to pair with one&#8217;s main dish,
this tutorial explores the pairing of Analytics and beers.
You&#8217;ll create a set of Analytics datasets based on the Couchbase beer-sample bucket and then explore a set of
illustrative queries as a quick way to get familiar with the new Analytics user experience.
The complete set of steps to create and connect the sample datasets are included, along with a collection of runnable
SQL&#43;&#43; queries and their expected results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you read through this document, you should try each step for yourself on your own Analytics instance.
You can use your favorite Analytics interface to do this: the Analytics Workbench, the <a href="../tools/cbq-shell.html">cbq shell</a>,
or the REST API. For details, see <a href="run-query.html">Runninq Queries</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can verify that everything&#8217;s working by issuing a simple SQL&#43;&#43; test query as shown below:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>"Let there be beer!";</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have reached the end of this tutorial, you will be armed and dangerous, having all the basic Analytics
knowledge that you&#8217;ll need to start down the path of exploring the power of NoSQL data analytics.
You will find this to be a freeing experience.
Analytics SQL&#43;&#43; queries never touch your Couchbase data servers, running instead (in parallel) on real-time shadow
copies of your data.
As a result, you&#8217;ll find yourself in a world where you can <em>ask the system anything!</em> - you won&#8217;t need to worry about
slowing down the Couchbase Server nodes with complex queries, you won&#8217;t have to create indexes to explore data,
and the Analytics query language (SQL&#43;&#43;) won&#8217;t try to keep you from asking queries that would be too performance-costly.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section you will learn about the Analytics world model for data.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="Organizing_data_in_analytics"><a class="anchor" href="#Organizing_data_in_analytics"></a>Organizing Data in Analytics</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The top-level organizing concept in the Analytics data world is the <em>dataverse</em>.
A <strong>dataverse</strong>, short for data universe, is a namespace that gives you a place to create and manage datasets and
other artifacts for a given Analytics application.
In that respect, a dataverse is similar to a database or a schema in a relational DBMS.
To store your data in Analytics, you create a dataverse and then use it to hold the <em>datasets</em> for your own data.
We&#8217;ll get to this next.
You get a <em>Default</em> dataverse for free, and Analytics will just use that if you don&#8217;t specify another dataverse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Datasets</strong> are containers that hold collections of JSON objects.
They are similar to tables in an RDBMS or keyspaces in N1QL.
In this tutorial, all of the datasets you create contain real-time synchronized copies of selected data from
Couchbase Server.
Analytics uses DCP to automatically maintain its own local representations for the JSON documents in the Couchbase
Server data nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK, let&#8217;s put these concepts to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A newly created Analytics instance starts out <em>empty</em>.
That is, it contains no data other than the Analytics system catalogs.
These system catalogs live in a special dataverse called the <strong>Metadata</strong> dataverse.
If you want to know what dataverses have been defined so far, you can query the Dataverse dataset in the Metadata
dataverse as shown below:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT * FROM Metadata.`Dataverse`;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The output will look as follows on a freshly installed system:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[
  {
    "Dataverse": {
      "DataverseName": "Default",
      "DataFormat": "org.apache.asterix.runtime.formats.NonTaggedDataFormat",
      "Timestamp": "Fri Jul 07 17:22:27 PDT 2017",
      "PendingOp": 0
    }
  },
  {
    "Dataverse": {
      "DataverseName": "Metadata",
      "DataFormat": "org.apache.asterix.runtime.formats.NonTaggedDataFormat",
      "Timestamp": "Fri Jul 07 17:22:27 PDT 2017",
      "PendingOp": 0
    }
  }
]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The output above shows that a fresh Analytics instance starts out with two dataverses, one called <em>Metadata</em>
(the system catalog) and one called <em>Default</em> (available for holding data).
This sample scenario deals with the information about beers and breweries, which you&#8217;ll need to get from
Couchbase Server.
To keep things simple, we will use the <em>Default</em> dataverse here.
That means your first task is to tell Analytics about the Couchbase Server data that you want to shadow and the
datasets where you want it to live.
The following Analytics DDL statements show you how to tell Analytics about the
<code>beer-sample</code> bucket in Couchbase Server,
where all of the beer and brewery information resides, and ask Analytics to shadow the data using two datasets,
<code>breweries</code> and <code>beers</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>CREATE BUCKET beerBucket WITH {"name":"beer-sample"};
CREATE DATASET breweries ON beerBucket WHERE `type` = "brewery";
CREATE DATASET beers ON beerBucket WHERE `type` = "beer";</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first statement (<em>CREATE BUCKET</em>) gives Analytics the information needed to access the data of interest from
Couchbase Server.
The next two statements (<em>CREATE DATASET</em>) create the target datasets in Analytics for the information of interest.
Notice how <em>WHERE</em> clauses are utilized to direct beer-related data into separate, type-specific datasets for easier
querying.
Each of these datasets will be hash-partitioned (sharded) across all of the nodes running instances of the Analytics
service.
Hash partitioning sets the stage for the parallel processing that Analytics employs when processing analytical queries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To actually initiate the shadowing relationship of these datasets to the data in Couchbase Server, one more step is
needed, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>CONNECT BUCKET beerBucket;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you run this statement, Analytics begins making its copy of the Couchbase Server documents and continuously
monitors it for changes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="Whats_lurking_in_the_shadows"><a class="anchor" href="#Whats_lurking_in_the_shadows"></a>What&#8217;s Lurking in the Shadows?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, verify that your datasets are really there and being populated.
The following SQL&#43;&#43; <em>SELECT</em> statements are one good way to accomplish that:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT ds.BucketName, ds.DatasetName, ds.`Filter`
FROM Metadata.`Dataset` ds
WHERE ds.DataverseName = "Default";</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The query looks in the Analytics system catalogs for datasets that have been created in the <em>Default</em> dataverse.
At this point, assuming that you are just getting started, you will see only your two new datasets:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[ {
    "DatasetName" : "beers",
    "BucketName" : "beerBucket",
    "Filter" : "`type` = \"beer\""
}, {
    "DatasetName" : "breweries",
    "BucketName" : "beerBucket",
    "Filter" : "`type` = \"brewery\""
} ]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following query asks Analytics the number of breweries:</p>

<h2 id="SQL++_querying_your_analytics_data"><a class="anchor" href="#SQL++_querying_your_analytics_data"></a>SQL&#43;&#43;: Querying Your Analytics Data</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Congratulations! You now have your Couchbase Server beer-related data being shadowed in Analytics.
You&#8217;re ready to start running ad hoc queries against your breweries and beers datasets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To do this, you&#8217;ll program Analytics using the SQL&#43;&#43; query language, a SQL-inspired language
designed for working with semistructured data.
SQL&#43;&#43; has much in common with SQL, but there are differences due to the data model that SQL&#43;&#43; is designed to serve.
SQL was designed in the 1970&#8217;s to interact with the flat, schema-ified world of relational databases.
SQL&#43;&#43; is designed for the nested, schema-less (or schema-optional, in Analytics) world of NoSQL systems.
SQL&#43;&#43; offers a mostly familiar paradigm for experienced SQL users to use to query and manipulate data
in Analytics.
SQL&#43;&#43; is also related to N1QL, the current query language used in Couchbase Server.
SQL&#43;&#43; is really a functional superset of N1QL that is a bit closer to SQL,
and the differences between N1QL and SQL&#43;&#43; will eventually disappear in the future releases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, we introduce SQL&#43;&#43; via a set of example queries with their expected results,
based on the data above, to help you get started. Many of the most important features of SQL&#43;&#43; are
presented in this set of representative queries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For more information on the query language, see <a href="1_intro.html">SQL&#43;&#43; Language Reference</a>
and the list of built-in functions in the <a href="8_builtin.html">Function Reference</a>.
As you will learn, SQL&#43;&#43; is a highly composable expression language.
Even the very simple expression <code>1 + 1</code> is a valid SQL&#43;&#43; query that evaluates to
<code>2</code>.
Try it for yourself!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that each time you execute a SQL&#43;&#43; query, the Analytics query engine employs state-of-the-art
parallel processing algorithms similar to those used by the parallel relational DBMSs that power many
enterprise data warehouses. Unlike those systems, Analytics also works on rich, flexible schema data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s go ahead and write some queries and start learning SQL&#43;&#43; through examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="Query_0_key_based_lookup"><a class="anchor" href="#Query_0_key_based_lookup"></a>Query 0 - Key-Based Lookup</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For your first query, let&#8217;s find a particular brewery based on its Couchbase Server key.
You can do this for the Kona Brewing company as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT meta(bw) AS meta, bw AS data
FROM breweries bw
WHERE meta(bw).id = 'kona_brewing';</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As in SQL, the query&#8217;s <em>FROM</em> clause binds the variable <code>bw</code> incrementally
to the data instances residing in the dataset named breweries.
Its <em>WHERE</em> clause selects only those bindings having the primary key of interest; the key is accessed (as in N1QL)
by using the meta function to get to the meta-information about the objects.
The <em>SELECT</em> clause returns all of the meta-information plus the data value (the selected brewery object in this
case) for each binding that satisfies the predicate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The expected result for this query is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="Query_3"><a class="anchor" href="#Query_3"></a>Query 3 (and friends) - Equijoin</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to simply binding variables to data instances and returning them <em>whole</em>, a SQL&#43;&#43; query can construct new
objects to return based on combinations of variable bindings.
This gives SQL&#43;&#43; the power to do projections and joins much like those done using multi-table <em>FROM</em> clauses in SQL.
For example, suppose that you wanted a list of all breweries paired with their associated beers, with the list
enumerating the brewery name and the beer name for each such pair.
You can do this as follows in SQL&#43;&#43;, while also limiting the answer set size to at most 3 results:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT bw.name AS brewer, br.name AS beer
FROM breweries bw, beers br
WHERE br.brewery_id = meta(bw).id
ORDER BY bw.name, br.name
LIMIT 3;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result of this query is a sequence of new objects, one for each brewery/beer pair.
Each instance in the result will be a object containing two fields, "brewer" and "beer", containing the brewery&#8217;s
name and the beer&#8217;s name, respectively, for each brewery/beer pair.
Notice how the use of a SQL-style <em>SELECT</em> clause, as opposed to the new SQL&#43;&#43; <em>SELECT VALUE</em> clause, automatically
results in the construction of a new object value for each result.</p>

<h3 id="Query_4"><a class="anchor" href="#Query_4"></a>Query 4 - Nested Outer Join</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to support joins between tables with missing or dangling join tuples, the designers of SQL ended up
shoe-horning a subset of the relational algebra into SQL&#8217;s <em>FROM</em> clause syntax and providing a variety of join types
there for users to choose from (which SQL&#43;&#43; supports for SQL compatibility).
Left outer joins are particularly important in SQL, for example, to print a summary of customers and orders, grouped
by customer, without omitting those customers who haven&#8217;t placed any orders yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SQL&#43;&#43; language supports nesting, both of queries and of query results, and the combination allows for a cleaner
and more natural approach to such queries.
As an example, suppose you wanted for each brewery to produce an object that contains the brewery name along with a
list of all of the brewery&#8217;s offered beer names and alcohol percentages.
In the flat (also known as 1NF) world of SQL, approximating this query would involve a left outer join between
breweries and beers, ordered by brewery, with the brewery name being repeated along side each beer&#8217;s information.
In the richer (NoSQL) world of SQL&#43;&#43;, this use case can be handled more naturally as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT bw.name AS brewer,
  (SELECT br.name, br.abv FROM beers br
   WHERE br.brewery_id = meta(bw).id
   ORDER BY br.name) AS beers
FROM breweries bw
ORDER BY bw.name
LIMIT 2;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This SQL&#43;&#43; query binds the variable <code>bw</code> to the objects in breweries; for each
brewery, it constructs a result object containing a "brewer" field with the brewery&#8217;s name plus a "beers" field with
a nested collection of objects containing the beer name and alcohol percentage for each of the brewery&#8217;s beers.
The nested collection field for each brewery is created using a correlated subquery.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The expressive power of SQL&#43;&#43; includes support for queries involving <em>some</em> (existentially quantified)
and <em>all</em> (universally quantified) query semantics.
Quantified predicates are especially useful for querying datasets involving nested collections of objects, in order
to find objects where some or all of their nested sets' objects satisfy a condition of interest.
To illustrate their use in such situations, we start here by using another (orthogonal) feature of SQL&#43;&#43;, its <em>WITH</em>
clause, to create a temporarily nested view of breweries and their beers.
We then use an existential (<em>SOME</em>) predicate to find those breweries whose beers include at least one IPA and return
the brewery&#8217;s name, phone number, and complete list of beer names and associated alcohol levels.
Here is the resulting SQL&#43;&#43; query:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like SQL, the SQL&#43;&#43; language of Analytics provides support for computing aggregates over large amounts of data.
As a very simple example, the following SQL&#43;&#43; query computes the total number of beers in a SQL-like way:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_beers FROM beers;</pre>

    "num_beers" : 5891
} ]</pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an <em>unwrapped</em> value is preferred, the following variant could be used instead:</p>

<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT VALUE COUNT(b) FROM beers b;</pre>

<p>This time the result will simply be:</p>

<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[
  5891
]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In SQL&#43;&#43;, aggregate functions can be applied to arbitrary collections, including subquery results.
To illustrate, here is a less SQL-like, and also more explicit, way to express the query above:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT VALUE ARRAY_COUNT((SELECT b FROM beers b));</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For each traditional SQL aggregate function <em>F</em>, SQL&#43;&#43; has a corresponding function <em>ARRAY_F</em> that
can be used to perform the desired aggregate calculation.
Each such function is a regular function that takes a collection-valued argument to aggregate over.
Thus, the query above counts the results produced by the beer selection subquery, and the previous, more SQL-like
versions are just syntactic sugar for SQL&#43;&#43; queries that logically use <em>ARRAY_COUNT</em>.</p>

<h3 id="Query_9"><a class="anchor" href="#Query_9"></a>Query 9 (and friends) - Grouping and Aggregation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also like SQL, SQL&#43;&#43; supports grouped aggregation.
For each brewery that offers more than 30 beers, the following group-by or aggregate query reports the number of
beers that it offers.</p>

<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT br.brewery_id, COUNT(*) AS num_beers

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>FROM</em> clause incrementally binds the variable <code>br</code> to beers, and the <em>GROUP
BY</em> clause groups the beers by their associated brewery id.
Unlike SQL, where data is tabular (flat), the data model underlying SQL&#43;&#43; allows for nesting.
Thus, due to the <em>GROUP BY</em> clause, the <em>SELECT</em> clause in this query sees a sequence of <em>br</em> groups, with each such
group having an associated <code>brewery_id</code> variable value (that is the producing
brewery&#8217;s id).
In the context of the <em>SELECT</em> clause, <code>brewery_id</code> is bound to the brewery&#8217;s id
and <code>br</code> is now re-bound (due to grouping) to the <em>set</em> of beers issued by that
brewery.
The <em>SELECT</em> clause yields a result object containing the brewery&#8217;s id and the count of the items in the associated
beer set.
The query result will contain one such object per brewery id.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last but not least, if you&#8217;re a database fan who has come this far, you may be wondering about indexing.
Indeed, in addition to the use of efficient parallel execution strategies for large analytical queries,
Couchbase Analytics provides support for the use of indexes to speed the execution of smaller queries.
For example, consider the following query:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT VALUE br
FROM beers br
WHERE br.brewery_id = 'kona_brewing';</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following DDL statements could be used to accelerate its execution for a large collection of beers:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>DISCONNECT BUCKET beerBucket;
CREATE INDEX brewerIndex ON beers (brewery_id: STRING);
CONNECT BUCKET beerBucket;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that index creation requires temporary suspension of the shadowing process, although queries on the accumulated
data can continue to be run while shadowing is on hold and the index is being built.
Note also that a CREATE INDEX statement needs to specify the type as well as the name of the field to be indexed; the
above brewerIndex will be used to speed queries that have string-based brewery_id predicates.</p>
