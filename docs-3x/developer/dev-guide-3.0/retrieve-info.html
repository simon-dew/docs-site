	<h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">Retrieving information</h1>

	<div class="body conbody">
		<p class="p">These operations are used for retrieving information from Couchbase and exist for all SDKs
			provided by Couchbase. They include <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp>, performing a multiple-retrieve,
			get-and-touch, and get-with-CAS. They enable you to retrieve individual items of
			information, retrieve data as a collection of documents, retrieve data while updating the
			expiration date for the data, and retrieving a value and the CAS value for document.</p>

		<p class="p">For more information about connections and connection-level settings, see <a class="xref" href="app-performance.html#concept_gmj_qss_np__optimize-instances">Optimizing client instances</a> and 
			<a class="xref" href="common-errors.html#concept7680__client-timeouts">Client-side timeouts</a>.</p>

		<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Get</h2>
			
			<p class="p">You can use this operation for a document you want to change, or for a document you want
				to read, but not necessarily update or edit. In this first scenario where you want to
				change a value, you would perform a <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> and assign the value that
				Couchbase returns to a variable. After you change the value of the variable, you would
				store the new value to Couchbase Server with one of the store or update methods:
					<samp class="ph codeph">set</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">add</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">replace</samp> or for
				optimistic concurrency, <samp class="ph codeph">cas</samp>. For instance, following our example of a
				spaceship game, the case of spaceship fuel is a scenario where you will probably
				constantly change fuel level with player interaction. In this case, you could perform a
				retrieve, update and then store.</p>

			<p class="p">There are also cases where you could use <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> to retrieve a value, but
				only as a read-only operation. An example of when you do want to read in the value but
				not change the value is if you have a game with player profiles. Imagine you have
				documents that represent different users and their attributes. The user profile are part
				of the player experience, but game play does not change the profile or their properties,
				such as contact information. In this case, we perform <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> to retrieve
				and display a play profile.</p>

			<p class="p">A related scenario is when we use a <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> to determine if a key exists,
				and if it does not exist, perform some action. For instance, if a player creates a user
				profile, we could try to read in the player profile with <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp>, and if it
				does not exist, we can create the new profile including information such as the player
				email address:</p>

			<img class="image" src="images/get_alt.png">
			<p class="p">Developers who are starting with Couchbase Server will rely heavily on
					<samp class="ph codeph">get/set</samp> requests to do all of their read and write operations. The
				majority of the time, <samp class="ph codeph">get/set</samp> operations are the most useful Couchbase
				methods for your application.</p>

			<p class="p">Over time, developers discover other Couchbase methods, and the benefits to using
				alternative read/write operations in their application logic. One advantage is that
				applications in multi-user environments may inadvertently overwrite the latest key you
				retrieve using only <samp class="ph codeph">get/set</samp>, therefore in a multi-user environment you
				might not be able to always rely on that value being valid and current if you plan to
				perform operations on it after the <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp>. In this case, there are
				alternate methods, such as get-with-cas and <samp class="ph codeph">cas</samp> that can provide
				optimistic concurrency.</p>

			<p class="p">There is one problem you can encounter if you use <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> to make sure that
				a key exists before they perform some operation. This can cause problems if the value
				for a key is large and can result in slower application performance. An alternate, more
				efficient way to test if a key exists, without retrieving the whole key, is to use
					<samp class="ph codeph">touch</samp>, which only updates the expiration, but does not retrieve the
				whole value. Even this approach has a drawback; you can use <samp class="ph codeph">touch</samp> to
				determine the key exists, but you will be working on the assumption that the item does
				not expire by the time you perform your next operation on it.</p>

			<p class="p">The other important assumption you are making when you use this approach is that when
				you touch to test for existence of an item, you must overwrite the TTL at the same time.
				If you know an item does not have an expiration, then you can use the touch approach as
				a workaround. If your application depends on the item expiration, you should not use the
				touch approach because this would overwrite your expiration.</p>

			<p class="p">Finally, if you use <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> make sure you are aware of the value size, and
				how many times you are repeatedly performing the operation. There may be alternate
				convenience methods which can handle your task with a less resource-consuming
				request.</p>

			<p class="p">The simplest case of retrieving information is by using <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> with a
				single key. Here is an example in Ruby:</p>

			<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">c.get("foo")
</samp></code></pre>

			<p class="p">The following PHP example demonstrates use of <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> to retrieve a user
				password from Couchbase Server and compare it to a password provided in a web form:</p>

			<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">$submitted_passwordHash = sha1($password);
        $db_passwordHash = $cb_obj -&gt; get($userid_key);

        if($db_passwordHash == false) {
            return (false);
        }
        //do we match the password?
        if($db_passwordHash == $submitted_passwordHash) {
            $_SESSION{"userid"} = $userid;
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
</samp></code></pre>

			<p class="p">In this case we perform <samp class="ph codeph">$userid_key</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">$password</samp> are
				based on parameters a user provides in a web form. We perform a <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp>
				with <samp class="ph codeph">$userid_key</samp> to retrieve the user password which is stored in
				Couchbase Server. If the password provided in the form matches the password in Couchbase
				Server, we create a new user session, otherwise we return false.</p>

			<p class="p">The memcached protocol which relate to this method are <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> and
					<samp class="ph codeph">getk</samp>. These first is the operation for retrieving an item; the later
				is for getting the value and the key. For more information about memcached protocol, see
					<a class="xref" href="https://github.com/memcached/memcached/blob/master/doc/protocol.txt" target="_blank">memcached protocol</a>.</p>

			<p class="p">If a key does not exist, you will receive a ‘key not found’ type error as a response to
					<samp class="ph codeph">get</samp>. If you expected the key to actually exist, you should check
				your application logic to see why it does not exist. Any logic that creates that type of
				key, or any logic that deletes it may inadvertently cause this result. Another reason
				why you might get this error is that the item expired; in this case Couchbase Server
				will respond to the request with a ‘key not found’ error. So you will also want to check
				any explicit expiration set for that key.</p>

			<p class="p">In the case where you use a <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> to determine if key does not exist and
				then store it, you can attempt a <samp class="ph codeph">set</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">add</samp> to create
				the key.</p>

			<p class="p">The types of errors that can occur during this operation include 1) inability to connect
				to a node, or 2) some error exists while attempting to format a value being retrieved.
				If you have a connection-level error you may need to reattempt connection, and possibly
				check the status of the server. If you have an error with the size of your value or
				formatting, you need to check the value itself, and how it is encoded and see if there
				are any issues that make the document incompatible with Couchbase Server.</p>

			<p class="p">There are variations for parameters used in the <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> depending on the
				SDK. For instance, some SDKs, such as the one for Java, support providing a transcoder
				that will manipulate a value after it retrieves it (for instance, remove and replace
				underscores with spaces.) Refer to an individual SDK’s API documentation for more
				information.</p>

		<section class="section" id="concept16930__retrieve-multiple-keys"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Retrieving multiple keys</h2>
			
			<p class="p">In the case of our spaceship game example, we create space environment which contains
				multiple planets and discussed how we could use <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> to retrieve
				documents that represent the planets. In reality if we want to retrieve more than one
				document, and do so efficiently, we would use one of the forms bulk-retrieves. This
				enables us to send a single request from our SDK for all the keys we want to
				retrieve.</p>

			<p class="p">Developers that are new to Couchbase Server tend to heavily rely on <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp>
				to retrieve values, even sets of values. However, using a form of multiple-retrieve may
				be a better approach if you are doing multiple retrievals.</p>

			<p class="p">The major advantages of using a multiple-retrieve is that you can make a single request
				to Couchbase Server from an SDK. The alternate you could choose is to make multiple,
				sequential <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> requests and your application needs to wait for the SDK
				to make each of these requests. This approach has the performance disadvantage of
				creating a separate request that Couchbase Server must then individually respond to. For
				instance if you want to retrieve 100 keys, you could do this as a multiple-retrieve and
				all keys could be retrieved in 1 millisecond. If you chose to do 100
					<samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> calls, this would take the equivalent of 100 milliseconds. In
				short, if you are retrieving multiple keys, performing a multiple-retrieve will improve
				application performance compared to performing a regular <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp>.</p>

			<p class="p">Using a multiple-retrieve is particularly suited in cases where you have ‘object-graphs’
				in your application. An object graph exists in your data model when you have one
				primary, ‘root’ object and that object owns or links-to several other objects. For
				instance, a farm can have several farm animals; or a solar system can have several
				planets. In the case of a solar system, you could have one JSON document represent the
				solar system, and that document references the planets in the solar system. You could
				then use a form of multiple-retrieve to construction the solar system in your
				application:</p>

			<img class="image" src="images/multi_get2.0.png">
			<p class="p">There are other cases where you have multiple objects related to a process and it would
				be better to use indexing and querying with views instead of a multiple-retrieve. These
				are typically cases where you do not have a relationship of ownership/possession by a
				root object. For instance in the case of a game leader board, individual user documents
				do not necessarily relate to the leader board object; only user documents with a high
				scores should be retrieved and displayed for a leader board. In this type of scenario,
				it is a better alternative to do indexing and querying with views in order to find the
				top score holders. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="find-data.html#concept1470">Finding data with views</a>.</p>

			<p class="p">This example demonstrates how to retrieve multiple keys, using different method
				overloads in Ruby:</p>

			<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">keys = ["foo", "bar","baz"]

// alternate method signatures for multiple-retrieve

conn.get(keys)

conn.get(["foo", "bar", "baz"])

conn.get("foo", "bar", "baz")
</samp></code></pre>

			<p class="p">In this case, we can overload the standard <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> method signature to
				include several keys.</p>

			<p class="p">In the case of other languages, such as Java, there is a separate method, called
					<samp class="ph codeph">getBulk</samp> which will retrieve keys provided in a string
				collection:</p>

			<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">Map&lt;String,Object&gt; keyvalues = client.getBulk(keylist);
</samp></code></pre>

			<p class="p">There are some cases where you want to perform a multiple-retrieve but you know the
				operation will take longer than a user will want to wait, or you want to perform the
				operation in the background while the application performs other tasks. In a spaceship
				game, for instance, you want to retrieve all the profiles of users who have a high score
				to display in a leader board. But in the meantime, you want players to be able to
				continue playing their game.</p>

			<p class="p">In this case, you can perform a multiple-retrieve asynchronously. When you do so,
				multiple-retrieve will return before the SDK sends a request to Couchbase Server. Your
				game application continues for the player and they can play their game. In the
				background, Couchbase Server retrieves all the specified keys that exist and sends these
				documents to the client SDK. Your application can later retrieve the documents if they
				exist, or perform error-handling if the documents do not exist. The following
				demonstrates an asynchronous multiple-retrieve in PHP:</p>

			<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">$cb-&gt;set('int', 99);
$cb-&gt;set('string', 'a simple string');
$cb-&gt;set('array', array(11, 12));

$cb-&gt;getDelayed(array('int', 'array'), true);
var_dump($cb-&gt;fetchAll());
</samp></code></pre>

			<p class="p">In this case <samp class="ph codeph">getDelayed</samp> returns immediately and we retrieve all the
				keys later by performing <samp class="ph codeph">fetchAll</samp>.</p>

			<p class="p">The multiple-retrieve methods in Couchbase SDKs are based on sending multiple
					<samp class="ph codeph">getq</samp> in the memcached protocol in a single binary packet. </p>

			<p class="p">When you do a multiple-retrieve, be aware that the method will return values for the
				keys that exist. If a key does not exist, Couchbase Server returns a ‘key not found’
				error which the SDK interprets. If a key is missing, SDK do not provide a placeholder in
				the result set for the missing key. Therefore do not assume that the order of results
				will be the same as the order of the keys you provide. If your application depends on
				all keys existing and being retrieved, you should provide application logic that
				iterates through the results and checks to see the number results matches the number of
				keys. You might also want to provide logic that sorts the results so they map to your
				sequence of keys.</p>

			<p class="p">If you expected a key to actually exist, but it does not appear in a result set, you
				should check your application logic to see why it does not exist. Any logic that creates
				that type of key, or any logic that deletes it may inadvertently cause this result.
				Another reason why you might get this result is that the item expired and Couchbase
				Server returns a ‘key not found’ error. So you will want to check any explicit
				expiration set for that key.</p>

			<p class="p">One option to handle this result is to create the value if it does not already exist.
				After you receive this result you can attempt a <samp class="ph codeph">set</samp> or
					<samp class="ph codeph">add</samp> to create the key.</p>

			<p class="p">The types of errors that can occur during this operation include 1) inability to connect
				to a node, or 2) some error exists while attempting to format values being retrieved. If
				you have a connection-level error you may need to reattempt connection, and possibly
				check the status of the server. If you have an error with the size of your value or
				formatting, you need to check the value itself, and how it is encoded and see if there
				are any issues that make the document incompatible with Couchbase Server.</p>

		</section>

		<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Get and touch</h2>
			
			<p class="p">When you perform a <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> you may also want to update the expiration for
				that document. This is called a ‘get-and-touch’ operation and can be completed in a
				single request to Couchbase Server. This saves you the time from having to do a get and
				then a separate operation to update the expiration. This method is useful for scenarios
				where you have a document that should eventually expire, but perhaps you want to keep
				that document around when it is still in use by the application. Therefore when you
				retrieve the document, you also update the expiration so it will be in Couchbase Server
				for a bit longer.</p>

			<p class="p">Going back to our spaceship game example, imagine that we have a special mode that a
				player can achieve. For instance, if they hit a special target they have temporary
				powers and can score more points for the next 30 seconds of play.</p>

			<p class="p">In this case, you could represent this temporary play mode as a document named
				username_power_up_mode for instance. The document could have attributes related to this
				special play mode, such as double-points or triple-point scoring. Since the special play
				mode will only last 30 seconds, when you get the power_up_mode document you could also
				update the expiration so that it will also only exist for the next 30 seconds. To do
				this, you would perform a get-and-touch operation.</p>


			<img class="image" src="images/get_and_touch.png">

			<p class="p">If you need to constantly retrieve a document and update it to keep it stored longer,
				this method will also improve your application performance, when you compare it to using
				separate <samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">touch</samp> calls. When you use the
				separate calls, you effectively double the number of requests and responses between your
				application and Couchbase Server, thereby increasing response and request times and
				decreasing application performance. Therefore get-and-touch is preferable for heavy
				retrieve operations where you also want to update document expiration.</p>

			<p class="p">The next example demonstrates a get-and-touch in Ruby:</p>

			<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">val = c.get("foo", :ttl =&gt; 10)
</samp></code></pre>

			<p class="p">The Couchbase SDK get-and-touch methods are based on the memcached protocol command
					<samp class="ph codeph">get</samp> with a specified expiration. For more information about the
				protocol, see <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/memcached/memcached/blob/master/doc/protocol.txt" target="_blank">memcached protocol</a>.</p>

			<p class="p">If a key does not exist, you will get a ‘key does not exist’ type error in response. If
				you did not expect this result, you should check any application logic that creates that
				type of key, or any logic that deletes it may inadvertently cause this result. Another
				reason why you might get this result is that the item expired and Couchbase Server
				returns a ‘key not found.’ So you will want to check any explicit expiration set for
				that key.</p>

			<p class="p">One option to handle this result is to create the value and set the new expiration; you
				can attempt this with <samp class="ph codeph">set</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">add</samp>.</p>

			<p class="p">The types of errors that can occur during this operation include 1) inability to connect
				to a node, or 2) some error exists while attempting to format a value being retrieved.
				If you have a connection-level error you may need to reattempt connection, and possibly
				check the status of the server. If you have an error with the size of your value or
				formatting, you need to check the value itself, and how it is encoded and see if there
				are any issues that make the document incompatible with Couchbase Server.</p>
