      num_shards:
        type: integer
        description: Represents the maximum number of concurrent Sync Gateway Accelerator nodes that can be supported by the index. It is only necessary to override the default value for large Sync Gateway Accelerator clusters (> 16 nodes). Higher num_shards values can result in a more fragmented index, as entries in the index are grouped by shard. A higher num_shards value results in more work for index reads that scan all shards (in large backfill scenarios for example). Changing num_shards requires a flush to rebuild the channel index bucket.
        default: 16
      tombstone_compact_freq:
        type: integer
        description: How often tombstones should be compacted in the channel index. When compaction runs, it identifies tombstones that are older than the server's metadata purge interval and removes them from Sync Gateway Accelerator's channel index.

          If the connection to Couchbase Server is lost during normal operations, Sync Gateway Accelerator will automatically re-connect to another node in the cluster.

                This property specifies whether to enable the interoperability between Couchbase Mobile and Couchbase Server. Refer to Sync Gateway's [equivalent property](config-properties/index.html#1.5/databases-foo_db-enable_shared_bucket_access) for full details.
                
                The only difference when enabling **shared bucket access** with Sync Gateway Accelerator is that the `import_docs` property doesn't need to be set. Indeed, in a Sync Gateway + Sync Gateway Accelerator deployment, the import process is always shared between Sync Gateway Accelerator nodes.

              - Import+: This logging key was introduced in Sync Gateway 1.5 to help troubleshoot the import process of a document (this is the Sync Gateway process to make a document that was added through N1QL or the Server SDKs mobile-aware).
